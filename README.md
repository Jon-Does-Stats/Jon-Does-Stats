## ğŸ‘‹ Hey friends! ğŸ‘‹

I'm Jonathan, an aspiring data scientist and a recent M.S. Statistics grad.   I sincerely love spatiotemporal statistics and data visualization, and I've created this digital showcase to ensnare like-minded individuals and trap them in collaboration. Poke around the projects here and share your thoughts and suggestions.
