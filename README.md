## ðŸ‘‹ Hey friends! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jonathan, an aspiring data scientist and a recent M.S. Statistics grad.   I sincerely love spatiotemporal statistics and data visualization, and I've created this digital showcase to ensnare like-minded individuals and trap them in collaboration. Poke around the projects below and share your thoughts and suggestions. 

## :unicorn: I'm seeking employment! :unicorn:

I'm on the hunt for that first data science position, post-academia!  I'm hoping that position can be found at the intersection of spatial analysis, data viz, and computational statistics (programming).  I'd like to continue learning and teaching, so opportunity for collaboration and mentorship gets me excited too. 

My decade of professional experience in media analytics ensures hand-holding will be minimized :smile_cat:
